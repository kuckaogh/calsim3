!Sum of CVP storages - and accounting for effects of EWA
! 1.  Start-of-October storage conditions may be low due to last year's EWA operations.
! To prevent this from impacting allocations this year, add the EWA carried-over debt terms 
! assess in prevSep and situated at San Luis or NOD reservoirs (see EwaDebtI.wresl for definitions)
! to the sum of CVP's stored-water supplies when establishing the WSI for the CVP allocation procedure.
! This approach treats carried-over debt as an assumed supply in the present year. 
!
! 2.  Start-of-October storage conditions may be inflated because EWA operations have
! left carried-over "backed-up water" in the NOD reservoirs.  This would invite projects to plan
! on allocating more water than they should.  To prevent projects from over-allocating,
! subtract the EWA carried-over "backed-up water" (see EwaBackedUpWater.wresl for definitions)
! from the sum of CVP's stored-water supplies...
!
! Note for 1. and 2.:  Both EWA carried-over debt and backed-up water are beginning-of-month assessments,
! which prevents us from using carried-over debt and backed-up water assessments from October,
! which would be more appropriate.  The reason we have to use beginning of September assessments
! is because the logic gets implemented in D1485 & D1641 steps, which occur before the beginning-of-October
! assessment would occur in the EWA step.

/*  (1/9/04 L. Brekke) The header is tailored to explain the following goal.
The subsequent goal accomplishes the same objective, but with new
variables defined in PreEwaStorageMod.wresl.  Moreover, the new variables
(i.e. S*mod) allow for the supply adjustments to be erased if the 
NOD reservoirs spill (see comments in PreEwaStorageMod.wresl).  

Note:
The CVP San Luis adjustment (EwaDebtCvp2dv(prevSep) is never erased because it represents
SOD carried-over debt that should be assumed as supply in the present
year, and therefore the delivery target should be based on this 
additional supply regardless of CVP San Luis storage state.
