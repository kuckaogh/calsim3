! SoDeltaChannels.wresl
! This file implements the C_SJR053A and B flow split
! This flow split combined with the added Delta Net Depletion input at node OMR027
! and the reconfiguration of the south Delta flow schematic in CALSIM 3.0
! provides the appropriate flow to the new representation of the combined Old and
! and Middle River flow arc at C_OMR002.
!
! Flow equations are based on Old River/Middle River functions defined by Paul Hutton (Sep 2007)
