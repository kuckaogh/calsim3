! EWA_Purch_Est.wresl
! This file defines the annual purchase target and the north-south split.
! SOD purchases are made from several sources, mostly following a demand
! distribution pattern.  LVE will need to know an approximate pattern, so
! we will use an approximate distribution of SOD purchases made in the Long
! Term EWA EIS runs, rounded and skewed to get more water in the early part
! of the season to anticipate delivery debt.  This is May-Sept 15/24/24/24/13.

! The total EWA purchase target (in TAF) is year-type dependent,
! based on the Sac40-30-30 Index.

!In the next define, case April is different from EWA step's similar
!variable definition.  In the latter, the target is updated in May rather than April.
!This matters little during simulation - the step-to-step change made here is
!convenient here for defining LVE-EWA exchange created Apr-Dec.  In this sense, the
!annual EWA purchase target that could limit demand is updated at beginning of April
!and affects LVE release for April-Dec.  Updating the decision in May would have linked
!this April's LVE release to last May's EWA purchase target, which makes less sense.
