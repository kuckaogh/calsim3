This file is the section of Fremont and Sacramento weirs extracted from the weir_steps.wresl
file. It will be run only during cycle 6 and then these weirs will be
operated on daily approach as described in code of file weir_steps_dailyops.wresl

Sacramento River - Butte & Colusa Basin, and Weir Overflow Operation.
Weir and Overflow ratings are estimates and therefore subject to change.
River Miles based on miles above Collinsville.

NOTES:

- Weir flows are significantly influenced by backwater effects and weir submergence,
  making it difficult to measure or estimate weir spills.

- To simplify weir and overflow operation, the flow arcs are defined by a simple
  linear equation.  This should not be a significant issue in a real application,
  since actual weir flow is not terribly important output for a monthly time step.
  However, a reasonable representation of weir flow is more important for weekly
  and shorter time steps, especially daily; therefore, future revisions may be necessary.

- Since estimates of the river flow at weir crest elevation are reasonably known,
  this point was fixed in the analysis.  This approach was used for all weirs
  except the gated Sacramento Weir, as noted below.

- The weir flows are computed from the inflows to the nodes before taking deliveries
  out since this is the order that it's done in PROSIM.  Weir flows are not
  available to the demands at the nodes.

Sacramento Weir Flow to Yolo Bypass
- The Sacramento Weir is the only weir with operating gates (48).  The weir rating curve
  assumes all 48 gates are open.
- It appears that PROSIM also assumes the gates remain open at all times.  This operation
  will cause spills more frequently than would normally occur.  Under actual
  current operation, the gates remain closed during normal (non-flood) operation and are
  not opened until stages at the "I" Street gage exceed or are forecasted to exceed 27.5 feet.
  The 48 gates are then opened, as needed, to prevent stages greater than 29.0 ft.
  However, the complication is that the gates must remain open until stages in the river
  and bypass drop below the weir crest (river flows less than 37,000 cfs), when the gates
  can be raised.
- When the Sacramento Weir gates are opened during a flood, water flows upstream
  from the American River to the weir.  Therefore, the weir arc is included at
  the junction of the American River (Node 166).
- The weir logic, below, is a very simplified representation of weir gate operation,
  refinements may be required during model calibration.
