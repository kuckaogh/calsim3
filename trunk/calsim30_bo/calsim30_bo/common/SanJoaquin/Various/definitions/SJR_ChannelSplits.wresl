! SJR_ChannelSplits.wresl
! The following are defininitions and goals to split arcs within demand and channel arcs
! Revised by C. Hsu, 3/4/03, USBR, for review and documentation project

/*
Arc splits are used to route seperate types of water (beyond just the minimum in-stream
flow and excess flows) in channel arcs, and to delivery different types of water in delivery arcs.
Split-arcs for reservoir releases (plus VAMP releases from Exchange Contractors via DMC)
