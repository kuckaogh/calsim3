!!! Special Feather River Fish Criteria for Oct 15 - Nov 30 @ CP058

/*
Criteria being modeled:

If during the period of October 15 thru November 30, the flow in the Feather River at C.P. 058 is greater than
2500 cfs (except for flood release purposes), then the flow at C.P. 058 may not be less than 500 cfs below the
existing flow until after March 30.


How the Criteria is modeled:

The criteria only applies to a part of the month of October, so the trigger flow of 2500 cfs is flow weighted for
the entire month.  To compensate for the other half of the month that has no trigger, the trigger applied to the
entire month of October may be greater than 2500 cfs.  The triggers for October and November can be set in
'featherfish058.table'.

When the trigger is exceeded, a "price" must be paid (a minflow thru March as opposed to no minflow if the trigger
is not exceeded).  To avoid paying this price, releases for exports should be reduced to get below the trigger.
Releases to meet in-basin uses however, should never be reduced to get below the trigger.

If releases for flood control are made then no minimum flow is applied.
*/




!      In October and November, try to keep flow at CP058 < trigger otherwise pay the price
!      of a minflow(=OCT flow or NOV flow - 500cfs) through March.  Do this by reducing releases for exports if necessary.
!      If trigger is exceeded because of flood spills then no minflow is applied.

! I spoke with Aaron Miller, who consulted with John Leahigh, and he clarified what the operations
! for minimum flows along the Feather River should be.  Aaron informed me that the 2800 cfs criteria
! at the mouth and the Sunset Pumps criteria were meant to increase the river stage to assist diverters
! with their pumping heads.  This criteria was added at the time we were doing modeling for the FERC Relicensing.
! Since that time, DWR’s legal department argued that DWR was not responsible for maintaining stage,
! only flow volumes or rates.  Aaron said they no longer operate to the 2800 cfs criteria at the mouth nor to any 
! stage criteria at the Sunset Pumps.  They do however operate to the DFG minimum flow which is intended to be 
! adhered to for the entire river reach from below Thermalito to the mouth.  He said that they are aware of the
! Sunset Pump diversion and generally add additional flow to the DFG requirement to comply just below the Sunset
! Pumps.  For CalSim 3.0, we should have three locations for compliance with the DFG minimum: below Thermalito,
! below the Sunset Pumps, and at the mouth.  This should closely mimic the actual operations. E. Reyes 2/17/2011

!The following code for a 2800 cfs target at mouth is no longer applicable:
!DWR maintains flow at the "Mouth of Feather River" based on requirements of diversion pumping facilities.
!Their flow target depends on upstream Yuba and Oroville inflow, the DWR/DFG agreed flow target above Verona,
!and a 2800 cfs flow rate related to pumping facility requirements.
