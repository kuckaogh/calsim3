/*
NOTE 1: from an engineering stand-point, the capacity of the Delta-Transfer Pipeline (C431) is (Old River Pumping 
Capacity + AIP Pumping Capacity) - Old River Pipeline Capacity.  It is intended that the existing Old River 
Pipeline would be used to supply a portion of the conveyance capacity with the addition of a small connection 
between the OR Pipeline and the Delta-Transfer Pipeline.  Using Old River pipeline capacity for reservoir deliveries 
and including the small connection between the two pipelines has not been incorporated into the model structure.

NOTE 2: for a connection to Bethany, the existing Trasfer Pipeline would be used for releases only as the pressure
rating of the existing pipeline is not sufficient to deliver water to a 275 TAF reservoir.  A new Transfer-LV 
pipeline would be constructed parallel to the exisitng pipeline and used for reservoir filling and releasing.
The filling capacity would be equal to the Transfer Pumping Plant capacity, and the release cpacity would be
determined by the design criteria but no greater than the Transfer-Bethany pipeline capacity (assume existing 
400cfs pipeline used for CCWD deliveries, and new pipeline used for Bethany deliveries).
